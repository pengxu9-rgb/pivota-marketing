MCP, ACP and AP2 are the three building blocks of agentic commerce:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol): standardized access to product data and context.
- **ACP** (Agentic Commerce Protocol): a unified order lifecycle — cart, order, and fulfillment events.
- **AP2** (Agent Payments Protocol): direct, compliant agent↔merchant settlement with clear roles.

### Why it matters

- One integration for multiple merchant platforms
- Lower integration risk with consistent events and error semantics
- Direct settlements to merchants; no long payout windows

### Where Pivota fits

Pivota unifies MCP, ACP and AP2 into a single API. Agents can discover products, build carts, place orders and pay directly, across a federated merchant network.
